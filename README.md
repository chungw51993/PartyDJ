## Usage

To start using PartyDJ, simply go to the website and sign in using your Spotify Account. Your list will be empty in the beginning, but creating a playlist is easy just simply press the plus sign in the bottom right hand side. After creating your playlist you can use the share button to send the link to your friends so they can contribute to the playlist. Once you have songs in your playlist you can start jamming. As the creator of the playlist you can delete any songs that you don't want in your playlist and skip songs. As the listener you still have the power to gong the song if you don't like what your hearing and three gongs equals song getting skipped.
